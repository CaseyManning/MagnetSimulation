# Physics Research Magnet Simulation

A simulation of a system of spherical magnets


### Setup and Workflow

- Make sure you have Blender 2.8 installed (2.79 may work, but may cause issues)

- Open blender. When running a python program inside blender, you will probably see an error reading "Python Script Failed, look in the console for now". You may wonder "but where is the console", and the answer is: it does't exist! In order to see error messages for your python script, navigate to `/Applications/Blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS` (or wherever your blender is installed to, and run ./blender in your terminal. Then, the error messages will appear in that terminal window when you run a python script.

- You will probably want to be in the "Scripting" tab (on the top bar) for using blender


### Useful keyboard shortcuts
Space: Start simulation

Alt + P: Run python script

âŒ˜  + Shift + S: Save python script



I will work on creating a system to use the python API to apply forces to the magnets during the simulation, so I will update the readme with information on how to apply force / rotation to magnets at that point.
